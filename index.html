            <p>Some 50 years ago, the first elements of today's Institute for Community Inclusion, were formed as the Developmental Evaluation Clinic (At Boston Children's Hospital). In the years following, the modern ICI blossomed into leading disability focused training and research organization that you see today. Join us for a year of special events, celebrating 50 years of inclusion.
