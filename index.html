            <h2>50 Years of Inclusion</h2>
            <p>Some 50 years ago, the first elements of today's Institute for Community Inclusion, were formed as the Developmental Evaluation Clinic (At Boston Children's Hospital). In the years following, the modern ICI blossomed into leading disability focused training and research organization that you see today. Join us for a year of special events, celebrating 50 years of inclusion.

      <div>

        <time>1961–1963</time> President John F. Kennedy appoints the "President's Panel on Mental Retardation" in 1961. The Panel’s 1962 report contains many recommendations, including research, preventive health measures, strengthened educational programs, more comprehensive and improved clinical and social services, improved methods and facilities for care, a new legal and social concept of mental retardation, increased educational opportunities to learn about mental retardation, and public education and information programs.


The Panel’s report prompts the development of new legislation that authorizes funding for developmental research centers in university-affiliated facilities and community facilities for people with mental retardation. A national network is launched of University Centers for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities, or UCEDDs. Primarily based at public, land-grant universities, the UCEDDs provide a new national base for academic research into developmental disabilities.


Amendments to the Social Security Act increase services for maternal and child health, and fund studies in each state on the status of services for people with mental retardation.

      </div>

    </li>

    <li>

      <div>

        <time>1964</time> Children's Hospital (now Boston Children's Hospital) obtains funding for constructing 2 floors in the new Fegan Building to be devoted to clinical services for persons with developmental disabilities.

      </div>

    </li>

    <li>

      <div>

        <time>1967</time> The Developmental Evaluation Clinic (DEC) at Children's Hospital opens its doors on the 10th and 11th floors of the Fegan Building. Dr. Allen C. Crocker is the founder and first director of the DEC, which later grows into the Institute for Community Inclusion (ICI). The ICI is part of the national network of University Centers for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities (UCEDDs) that was begun by President Kennedy (see above).

      </div>

    </li>

    <li>

      <div>

        <time>1969</time>Grants that provide operational funding for the DEC are received from the federal departments of Maternal and Child Health and Social Rehabilitation Services. Collaboration is started with 2 Commonwealth of Massachusetts agencies: the Bureau of Education for the Handicapped, and the Department of Mental Health.

      </div>

    </li>

  <li>

      <div>

        <time>1969</time>Staffing grows to 17 professionals representing 10 disciplines. Collaboration with area universities is started, and the DEC provides training for their graduate–postgraduate students in variety of disciplines.

      </div>

    </li>

    <li>

      <div>

        <time>1969-72</time> Clinical and training programs grow. “Core” training curriculum is developed. Clinical services include comprehensive “primary evaluations” delivered by interdisciplinary teams to 4–8 children a week. 

      </div>

    </li>

   <li>

      <div>

        <time>1969-72</time> “Down I” program combines research and clinical services for young children (starting with newborns) who have Down syndrome. A demonstration preschool classroom is opened on Fegan 10 for children with disabilities in collaboration with the Massachusetts Department of Education and Mental Health.

      </div>

    </li>

    <li>

      <div>

        <time>1972</time> William (Bill) Kiernan, current dean of the School for Global Inclusion and Social Development at UMass Boston, and also director of ICI from 198? to 2016, is hired as a research associate at Children's Hospital.

      </div>

    </li>

 

<li>

      <div>

        <time>1972</time> Massachusetts Chapter 766 is passed, guaranteeing all children the right to a free, appropriate public education. It is the first USA special education law, and becomes the model for later federal legislation. The ICI, in partnership with the state, provides training for special education teachers, and “primary evaluation” meetings serve as model for school individualized education program (IEP) meetings.

      </div>

    </li>

    <li>

      <div>

        <time>1976</time> The Children's Hospital Work Experience Program (WEP) begins. The original idea for the WEP came from Sally Yateman, a social worker at the DEC, along with Bill Kiernan, as an alternative to summer camp for young adults in the Boston Public Schools. The WEP provides intensive training and supervision for young adults with disabilities who are placed in various departments at Children’s Hospital. Regular supportive groups are conducted for them by ICI vocational rehabilitation students and staff, led jointly with a DEC psychiatrist. This program continues today, providing people with disabilities opportunities for career exploration and the development of new skills to support them in achieving their employment goals. 

      </div>

    </li>

    <li>

      <div>

        <time>1976</time> ICI receives state contract for developing modern medical services at the Wrentham State School (WSS) (now called Wrentham Developmental Center), following a court ruling in a class action suit on behalf on the residents. Virtually all disciplines participate, especially medicine, nursing, psychiatry, and physical therapy. Additional staff is hired to provide on-site services and staff training. The conditions at WSS are markedly improved, and eventually court supervision is terminated. However, Dr. Norberto Alvarez, originally an early ICI trainee in neuropsychiatry, still works at Wrentham Developmental Center as a medical director. We need to check on this. 

      </div>

    </li>

  <li>

      <div>

        <time>1981-82</time> DEC receives supported work contract from Bay State Skills Corporation, a quasi-state agency charged with implementing supported work programs across the state. The programs provide job training, work experience, and job placement for people with disabilities.  

      </div>

    </li>

    <li>

      <div>

        <time>1987</time> The DEC’s growing vocational rehabilitation team and employment researchers move to the Gardner House on the BCH campus. This unit becomes known as the Training and Research Institute for People with Disabilities (TRIPD).  

      </div>

    </li>

    <li>

      <div>

        <time>1987</time> TRIPD staff works with the Boston College (BC) Campus School to start the BC Supported Employment Program.

      </div>

    </li>

    <li>

      <div>

        <time>1988</time> The Access to Integrated Employment project begins, funded by the Administration on Developmental Disabilities (now the Administration on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities). The project innovates by conducting large nationwide surveys about the employment outcomes of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. The first survey started earlier than this I think - Jean Cibirowski worked with BIll on it and we were still on Fegan 10.

      </div>

    </li>

    <li>

      <div>

        <time>1990</time> IThe TRIPD establishes its first office at UMass Boston.
