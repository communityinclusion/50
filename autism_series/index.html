          <h5>New ICI Series Expands Discussion of Autism</h5>

          <p class="lead">A new series of online conversations, hosted by the ICI, aims to move the conversation forward about full inclusion
            for people on the autism spectrum. </p>

          <p class="lead">Titled "Expanding the Dialogue on Autism: Reflections on Research & Real Life," the series of online talks will
            engage experts in the field of autism, some of whom are on the spectrum themselves. The goal is to look at ways
            that people on the spectrum are shattering outdated expectations about their potential, their success, and their
            engagement in education, employment, healthcare, and community life. </p>
